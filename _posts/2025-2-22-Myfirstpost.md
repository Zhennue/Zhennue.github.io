# What did you do?

Firstly, we were divided into expert groups, where we were given topics on Database Users and Database Administrators to discuss alternately. After discussing with our peers, we were further divided into home groups, where we shared what we had discussed over the past 20 minutes. The presentations to the home groups were completed within 10 minutes, and it was a valuable experience for both learning and presenting. Then came the moment of truthâ€”the quiz! Everyone faced the challenge with enthusiasm, and it was both a rewarding and enjoyable experience.



# How can it be improved?

. Active Learning Opportunities:
By moving lectures and content delivery to outside the classroom (via videos, readings, etc.), students can engage in active learning during class time. This allows them to work on projects, solve problems, and discuss concepts in a collaborative environment.

. Increased Student Engagement:
In a flipped classroom, students often have more control over the pace of their learning. They can pause videos, review content, or explore additional resources, which caters to different learning styles.

. Better Use of Class Time:
Class time can focus on discussion, problem-solving, and collaboration rather than passive listening. Teachers can provide personalized support, answer questions, and guide students through more complex activities.
